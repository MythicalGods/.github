## 🚀 Welcome to BackendDev! 🔥

👋 Hey there! This is where I keep all my backend projects nice and tidy. 

Here you'll find a collection of small case studies showcasing my skills in Python, Rust and Typescript. 🦀

### Before we dive in, here's a quick rundown of the rules:
- No boring names are allowed! 💤
- No JS! TypeScript only, sir 🚫
- Make sure to write a README! 📄
- Don't forget to write tests! 💻

And in case you're wondering, yes, I do have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript. Let's just say it's a personal preference and leave it at that, okay? 🙃

### Going on, a bit more about names: 
- All projects must have a generic name based on Mythical Gods 💫
- Once the job is done, it's time for the project to shine! It may get its own proper name 🌟
- If you think your project is extra special, you can request a proper name... but it better be good. 😉

That's it all! And don't forget: this organization is all about keeping my Github account organized and easy to navigate. Most of the time, you'll just see me hard at work on these projects. So if you're looking for some inspiration or just want to see what I'm up to, feel free to take a look around! 🔍

Have fun and enjoy your stay here! 🎉
